# RoadSurface
 A Large Crowdsourced Street View Dataset for Mapping Multiple Road Surface Types in Africa.The dataset and code are both uploaded and executed on Kaggle.
In the fortraining.ipynb file, it contains a Swin Transformer-based image classification model training script. Its main function is to train a three-class classification model using the PyTorch framework, evaluate performance on the validation set, and ultimately save the best-performing model.
In the fortesting.ipynb file, it contains a Swin Transformer-based image classification prediction script. Its main function is to classify images in the test set and save the prediction results to a CSV file.
